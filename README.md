# CS-350

I chose the first two milestones because they were the foundation of the course.  These two projects took a lot of time for me to be able to successfully complete them. In the first milestone, we wanted to be able to have our embedded system turn a light on or off based on the user input.  In the second milestone, we wanted to be able to send an SOS message.  With the SOS message, we wanted to be able to program the device to be able to switch between SOS and OK. 

I thought the best things I did in these assignments was reach out for help when I needed and use good spacing in the assignment. I think it's important to ask for help when it's needed.  In previous courses, I wouldn't always ask for help, so I wouldn't get the desired outcome. 

There are many areas I can improve on.  First, I can improve on coding in general . I have had a hard time trying to create code for projects.  I think time and practice is the only thing that is going to get me to understand how it works. I also need a lot of work with state machines because they still confuse me quite a bit. 

Usually when I run into issues, I can search online and see a similar problem being solved, which will give me some ideas on how I need to solve my problem.  I think bringing those external resources and people with experience in to help out will be a tremendous help in the future.

I think everything we learned from this course should help us in the future to some extent.  This was the second class I have use C in and it seemed like I started way over my head compared to what I learned in previous courses.  With that being said, I think be able to be adaptive helps out in future courses, projects, or any situation you might come across. 

To make the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable, the first step I took was to make sure there was good spacing.  Having good spacing helps me separate the different parts of the code and see the problem a little better. The other aspect to maintainable code is leaving comments.  This can help others figure out what's going on and  lealves yourself a note as well just in case you need to go back and fix something.
